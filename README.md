# Command Line JavaScript Quiz Application

## Project Overview

This project is a command-line quiz application built using JavaScript. The quiz is designed to test the user's knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals through a series of multiple-choice questions. The user will interact with the quiz via the command-line interface, providing their answers and receiving immediate feedback on their correctness.

## Project Objectives

- **Understanding JavaScript Concepts:** Demonstrate knowledge of values, types, operators, and basic program structure.
- **Program Structure:** Implement a clear and organized flow for the quiz, ensuring smooth user interaction.
- **Functions:** Utilize JavaScript functions to manage the quiz logic effectively.
- **Data Structures:** Use arrays and objects to handle quiz data, including questions and answers.

## Features

- **Multiple-Choice Questions:** The quiz consists of an array of objects, where each object contains a question, its possible answers, and the correct answer.
- **User Interaction:** Users will be prompted to answer one question at a time.
- **Immediate Feedback:** After each question, users will receive feedback indicating whether their answer was correct.
- **Score Tracking:** The application keeps track of the user's score and displays it at the end of the quiz.

## Project Requirements

- **JavaScript Arrays and Objects:** The quiz data is managed using arrays and objects, representing questions, options, and correct answers.
- **User Input:** Users provide their answers through the command-line interface.
- **Conditional Logic:** The application checks the user's answer against the correct one and provides immediate feedback.
- **Score Management:** The application tracks the user's score and displays the final score upon completion of the quiz.
